# Gif Your Mood :

This is a purely fun application that tries to find a gif that matches the user's current mood. The user chooses an emote, a joke, and a picture to calculate and find a perfect gif. The gif can be stored in a gallery so the user can enjoy a history of liked gif's. This project was designed to practice: git work flow with four different contributors, work with the CSS framework UIkit, and use different API's to deliver a final product.
